What is your site's primary purpose?

  To be a blog that accompanies my learning through phase-0 and bootcamp at devacademy. Provides a place to practice various web development techniques.

Who is your target audience?

  My target audience is anyone at DevAcademy, including all the students and teachers, but especially the Piwakawaka 2016 cohort.

How do you want site visitors to interact with your site? What experiences would you like them to have?

  I want visitors to interact with the site in a simple, intuitive way that also allows them to see all my blogs posts in an easy to read and enjoyable to use interface.
  Users should be able to click blog posts and read them, with pages loading quickly. They should be easily able to go back to the main page, and also navigate to other blog posts from other blogposts.

How will you build your site to support your desired user experience?

  I will have a good navigation bar, as well as links to other blogs at the bottom of blog posts. Will make things load quickly by having them optimised without too many unnecessary images and keep the size of the pages as low as possible.
